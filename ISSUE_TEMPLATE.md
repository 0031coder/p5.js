PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING AN ISSUE :)

ARE YOU ASKING FOR HELP?
The github issues are ONLY for bugs and feature requests for the p5.js library itself. For help with programming with p5.js, please use the p5.js forum instead: https://forum.processing.org/two/.

ARE YOU REPORTING AN ISSUE?
Please include a snippet of code that demonstrates that the described behavior is not the expected behavior. Use only the minimum amount of code necessary to reproduce the unexpected behavior. Bugs may be temporarily closed until you can provide this.

Thanks!
